To use GraphLinq you need to have an Ethereum wallet to launch a Graph. If you already have an Ethereum wallet you can skip to the end of this document.

On MetaMask, you can review your list of tokens and receive payments in your own ETH address.
You can use any of the compatible wallet over the list above:

</center>

You need to have a <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/202825/what%E2%80%99s-the-difference-between-chromium-and-chrome/">chromium</a> compatible browser to install browser based plugins which will allow you to create an Ethereum wallet. We suggest Chrome, Brave, or any browser that supports Web3.

MetaMask is the most mainstream and used extension.

Next you need to create a new wallet and properly backup your seed phrase. Most wallets have documentation on this process. Here is a blog article that walks you through <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-and-use-metamask-on-google-chrome/">installing and using MetaMask on Google Chrome</a>.

Once you have your wallet created and a new Ethereum address, you can use it to make transactions over the Ethereum network. If you have some GLQ in your wallet, MetaMask should automatically detect this and add the token to the list of your assets. You can refresh the list or add the token manually. Please be very careful to use the correct contract address!

Now, you can sign into the App Dashboard interface with your wallet and get registered with GraphLinq.  Select a wallet from the list on <a href="https://app.graphliq.io">app.graphlinq.io</a> then follow the steps:

You will need to sign a transaction that notifies us about the ownership of your wallet (it's signed with your private key) which allows the GraphLinq Engine to read and verify that future signed transactions are from your wallet. A session will start with the engine on your browser linked to the Engine network, you can now deploy and manage your graphs securely.
