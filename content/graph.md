Graphs are based on blocks developed from external and based libraries linked to the GraphLinq Engine and exported into a JSON format.

With a schema skeleton of function types and parameters, any IDE can be created to make a type of graph that follows the rules from the execution point of view.

This means that paths, blocks, execution, and parameters are generated from the based available types from the Engine code base, it's then converted into JSON instructions opcode that will be executed like in a VM autonomous state (graphs get their context and memory from its execution cycles).
