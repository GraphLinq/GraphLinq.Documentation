metaDescription: "The automation of decentralized data, monitoring, and external executions over multi-chain applications. "
---

The goal of GraphLinq is to provide a way to interact with the blockchain and with any connected system as effortlessly as possible, all without knowing how to code.

Setting up bots, or basic scripted logic, arbitrages on DEX or trading on a centralized exchange, we build the tools that help the decentralization adoption, every business has logic that can be automated, we make it possible through monitoring and execution over multi-blockchains data.

In this documentation, you will find the basic knowledge of the GraphLinq Protocol and will get a better idea of how things work.

# What exactly Graphlinq is and what is our vision?
GraphLinq is a set of tools including an IDE and an engine that run simultaneously with multiple blockchains and centralized data stream to offer a service of automatization of a process without coding skill required.

You can use the GLQ Token (ERC-20 Ethereum Token) to run a graph on our test net or our main net to execute different processes over the blockchain to automate your tasks, watching easily Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum transactions, triggering events, or doing conditional regular expression is possible with only a few nodes.

We believe that a lot of the job tasks run on mainstream crypto projects can be automated and generated with node graphs, so that the data can be listened to, triggered, and saved to a safe place accessible for maintaining service from an off-chain side, with the fewer fees and complexity.

# What is a Graph and how does it work?
A graph is a set of nodes attached that automate on-chain and off-chain tasks. Using the <b>GraphLinq IDE</b>, you can import any graph file (.glq file) or templates from our listed base graphs.<br/>
Once you're up and ready to deploy your graph, you can use the dashboard interface to upload it and execute it on the protocol.


# How can I run graphs on the Engine? Do I need a Wallet?
Nodes have a cost of execution, which is calculated as GAS, you need to register with your ETH wallet on the dashboard to sign a transaction to authenticate you on our Engine and get a session.

Once you are connected you need to deposit the wallet smart-contract to consume gas fees from the execution of your graph, it works like a cloud computing service. The fees will be taken from the smart-contract when you decide to withdraw your balance.

# So what is a node? And how much does it cost?
A node (blocks) is what graphs are made of, it describes the structure of your execution path. We prebuilt a set of nodes in the GraphLinq engine so that you can execute by passing through your needed parameters.

This means that you can launch on the Engine a set of blocks that automate a task without coding any of the business logic needed. To avoid having an overwhelm or a congested network we have to apply fees for execution (known as GAS on Ethereum network) each block type has a different cost of execution within its Cycle optimized by the network and CPU consumed by itself.

# Our founders, Behind GraphLinq
At GraphLinq, we believe that an extraordinary team focused on the same objectives can build and change the future of the crypto-market, that is our founder's missions,
helping blockchains be more accessible to everyone.
