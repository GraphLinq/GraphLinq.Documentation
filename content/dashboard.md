The dashboard is the inferface connected to your wallet and the engine mainnet network. From there you can deploy, manage states, and check the logs of your graphs. The only official url is <a href="https://app.graphlinq.io">app.graphlinq.io</a>

You can also buy the GLQ token automatically through the interface and manage your balance for the costs of your running graphs, make
deposit and withdrawal request from the ethereum smart-contract.
