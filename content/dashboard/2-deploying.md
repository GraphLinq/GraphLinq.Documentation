Once you're logged on the dashboard interface, you can select the "New Graph" Button over the Graph page that you can select on the Menu.

You then have to choose between modifying a template pre-made or directly importing a .GLQ file that you created on the IDE.

Next step is to select the 'Create' button and deploy the graph over the network, you will then see the hash and this message:
