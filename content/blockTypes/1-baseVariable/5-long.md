Conceptually, `Long` blocks are no different from <a href="/blockTypes/1-baseVariable/3-integer"> `Integer`</a> blocks: they both allow us to enter whole number values into our graphs.<p/>
The only difference between the integer data type and the long data type is the amount of memory allocated to store the data, which determines the maximum values we can use these data types for.<p/>
Integers are 32-bit, which means they can be used for any whole numbers from about negative 2.1 billion to positive 2.1 billion. Longs, on the other hand, are 64-bit, which means they can store any whole numbers between about negative 9.2 quintillion and positive 9.2 quintillion.
