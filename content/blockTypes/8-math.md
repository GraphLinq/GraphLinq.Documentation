This block category comprises blocks used to perform basic arithmetic.

Included are block types for all the basic arithmetic operators: <a href="/blockTypes/8-math/1-add"> `Add A + B`</a> blocks, <a href="/blockTypes/8-math/10-subtract"> `Subtract A - B`</a> blocks, <a href="/blockTypes/8-math/7-multiply"> `Multiply A * B`</a> blocks, <a href="/blockTypes/8-math/4-divide"> `Divide A / B`</a> blocks, and <a href="/blockTypes/8-math/6-modulo"> `Modulo A % B`</a> blocks.

This category also includes several block types related to rounding. <a href="/blockTypes/8-math/3-ceiling"> `Ceiling`</a> blocks round up to the nearest integer, <a href="/blockTypes/8-math/5-floor"> `Floor`</a> blocks round down to the nearest integer, and <a href="/blockTypes/8-math/9-round"> `Round`</a> blocks round to some given precision (significant digits after the decimal).

Finally, this category includes <a href="/blockTypes/8-math/8-percentageDifference"> `Percentage Difference`</a> blocks, which offer a quick way to calculate the percentage gain one number would need to undergo to become equal to another number.
