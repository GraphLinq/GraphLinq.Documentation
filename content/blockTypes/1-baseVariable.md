This category of blocks comprises block types that correspond to all the basic data types in computer science: <a href="/blockTypes/1-baseVariable/1-boolean"> `Boolean`</a>, <a href="/blockTypes/1-baseVariable/2-decimal"> `Decimal`</a>, <a href="/blockTypes/1-baseVariable/3-integer"> `Integer`</a>, <a href="/blockTypes/1-baseVariable/5-long"> `Long`</a>, and <a href="/blockTypes/1-baseVariable/6-string"> `String`</a>. Additionally, this category contains <a href="/blockTypes/1-baseVariable/11-secretString"> `Secret String`</a> blocks, which are equivalent to <a href="/blockTypes/1-baseVariable/6-string"> `String`</a> blocks in every way except that they hide their contents from whomever is viewing the graph file.<p/>

The block types listed above can be used to enter hard-coded data directly into our graphs (analgous in programming to using 'literals').<p/>
Moreover, by using the <a href="/blockTypes/1-baseVariable/9-setVariable"> `Set variable`</a> block, we can declare and assign to variables in order to save data within our graph's data context. Data stored this way can be retrieved with <a href="/blockTypes/1-baseVariable/7-getVariable"> `Get variable`</a> blocks.<p/>
This category also contains the <a href="/blockTypes/1-baseVariable/8-isVariableExist"> `Is Variable Exist`</a> block, which determines which path to execute based upon whether a variable by a given name has already been declared with a <a href="/blockTypes/1-baseVariable/9-setVariable"> `Set variable`</a> block.<p/>
Finally, this category also contains the <a href="/blockTypes/1-baseVariable/10-variablePortal"> `Variable Portal`</a> block, which allows us to pipe data from one area of our graph to another while keeping things visually tidy.<p/>
