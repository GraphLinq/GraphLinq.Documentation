This block category is for blocks that control executive flow (which yellow connection will fire next) based upon whether a given value is above the upper bound of a range, or below the lower bound of a range.

This category presently only contains one type of block: <a href="/blockTypes/15-rangeCondition/1-decimalRangeBranch"> `Decimal Range Branch`</a> blocks.
