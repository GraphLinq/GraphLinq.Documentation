This block category contains blocks used to manipulate string data (sequences of letters, digits, and special characters).<p/>

This category contains <a href="/blockTypes/6-string/1-concatString"> `Concat String`</a> blocks, which take two strings as input and then merge them together into a single string, which is then output.<p/>
It also contains <a href="/blockTypes/6-string/2-stringContains"> `String Contains`</a> blocks, which take two strings as input, and check whether the first string contains the second string as a substring (the way that the string "inigo montoya" contains the string "go monto").<p/>
Finally this category includes <a href="/blockTypes/6-string/3-replaceStringInString"> `Replace String In String`</a> blocks, which allow you to search through a string and replace every instance of some substring with some other third string. These are especially useful for substituting calculated values into textual messages.<p/>
