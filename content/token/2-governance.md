# Burning Policy

The burning of tokens involves the permanent removal of existing cryptocurrency coins from circulation. The practice of burning is quite common in the industry and is very simple. Token burning is a deliberate action taken by the creators in order to remove a certain number of available tokens from circulation.

Each time user pays for graphs execution, as an incentivize for the protocol continuation and evolution of the GraphLinq Protocol,
the GAS (GLQ) used for any of the graph running on the main-net network will be burned from the ERC-20 circulation, therefore reducing the supply of the asset overtime

GAS Price linked to a block type will be updated with time as to follow with the market adoption and the numbers of burned token.


# Dao Governance

The term DAO stands for “decentralized autonomous organization” and can be described as an open-source blockchain protocol governed by a set of rules, created by its elected members, that automatically execute certain actions without the need for intermediaries.

So, we let the community decide the future of GraphLinq development by voting on the best things to build.
Members we will be able to propose new blocks to add and update fees prices if needed for the network execution,
also for every need of a new library to link on the Engine.

We will use the Aragon protocol which is is the fastest and easiest way to set up an organization that can adapt to the challenges ahead as they describe themself.
You can browse to the list of organization and the future GraphLinq one on <a href="https://client.aragon.org/#/">client.aragon.org</a> to vote and give your
voice a matter over the next steps for GraphLinq advancements.
