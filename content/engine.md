metaDescription: "Quick summary about what is the Engine on GraphLinq"
---

The engine is the main core of GraphLinq Protocol. It's the software process that execute graphs over the network.
We deployed two different protocol layers for testing and using it in production to run your own graphs.

On the test-net you can deploy graph and test them for free but they have limited access and cycle length restrictions
while it is unlimited on the main-net and only need a balance cover-up in the engine depositor smart-contract.

From a coding perspective, the engine is developed and maintained into .net core 3.1 (known as C# language) which allow for a fast execution and a
cross-compatibility over any exploitation system.
